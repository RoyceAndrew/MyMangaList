HxH 2011 definitely brought life to the HxH manga, but the manga is still wholesome in its story and its characters. The current arc is in the running to be the best arc of HxH in my opinion.

The only low points for the manga are its artwork and the constant hiatuses. The art can range from scribbles on a page to fantastically drawn creatures and areas that even Miura of Berserk would approve of. And as every HxH fan knows, the hiatuses are the biggest flaw on this great series, as it keeps us from having a complete story for years to come.

Other than that, its a riveting experience start to finish.","Hunters are a special breed, dedicated to tracking down treasures, magical beasts, and even other men. But such pursuits require a license, and less than one in a hundred thousand can pass the grueling qualification exam. Those who do pass gain access to restricted areas, amazing stores of information, and the right to call themselves Hunters."

One day after meeting a new worker he is suddenly transformed into a half kaiju/half human and wishes to use this newfound power to fight back.

Similar in a way to Attack on Titan but it already feels like it has its own identity and direction in mind and wants to be a Kaiju battle series which Im personally all for. The art is clean and phenomenal and so far the Kaiju designs themselves are really unique and interesting, especially Kafkas himself. He has alot of emotion and expression in his Kaiju form and I cant wait to see what this series has it stock.","Kafka hopes to one day keep his pact with his childhood friend Mina to join the Japan Defense Force and fight by her side. But while she’s out neutralizing kaiju as Third Division captain, Kafka is stuck cleaning up the aftermath of her battles. When a sudden rule change makes Kafka eligible for the Defense Force, he decides to try out for the squad once more. There’s just one problem. He’s made the Defense Force’s neutralization list under the code name Kaiju No. 8."

Its 22 years and ongoing run is nothing short of incredible. During its run several cultural phenomena of old rose and concluded, some beginning side by side with One Piece and others only beginning their journey to the top as the next big hit. And I can say without a shadow of doubt that nothing will top One Piece for as long as it is in publication, the stories are only getting grander in scale and the decades old mysteries of the world are finally beginning to reveal themselves.

There’s a reason as to why One Piece has endured what to many might sound like a grueling run. 22 years as a mangaka takes a toll on a person, be it physically or mentally, at some point people break down due to the sheer amount of unrelenting work they have on their hands week after week. The manga industry not only a competitive environment that demands high performance and creativity but also an unrelenting and unforgiving beast that continues to eat at a person’s life even if you become successful. Only few have ever lasted long and even if they do, the quality of the stories either decline leading to a cancellation, or… hiatuses, long extended breaks that can last up to years.","Gol D. Roger, a man referred to as the ""Pirate King,"" is set to be executed by the World Government. But just before his demise, he confirms the existence of a great treasure, One Piece, located somewhere within the vast ocean known as the Grand Line. Announcing that One Piece can be claimed by anyone worthy enough to reach it, the Pirate King is executed and the Great Age of Pirates begins. Twenty-two years later, a young man by the name of Monkey D. Luffy is ready to embark on his own adventure, searching for One Piece and striving to become the new Pirate King. Armed with just a straw hat, a small boat, and an elastic body, he sets out on a fantastic journey to gather his own crew and a worthy ship that will take them across the Grand Line to claim the greatest status on the high seas."

If you answer yes then this epic manga is a must read.

The story is set during the golden age of the Vikings (11th century) particularly during the invasion of England. The main story is about Thorfinns quest to avenge his fathers death by defeating Askeladd (his fathers murderer) in an honorable duel and he plans to accomplish this by working for him and doing whatever Askelad asks and in return he is granted a chance to kill him in an honorable duel. The story however is not just focused on Thorfinn, in fact more focus is given to the other members of the cast particularly Askeladd who might actually be the real main character of the story and other historical figures such as Thorkell and Canute and their participation during the conflict of the era.

I personally loved the way each character both historical and fictional mix together during the viking age, i mean come on there is already an abundance of samurai and knights in the manga market but this might possibly be the only manga where the main characters are bloodthirsty Vikings who enjoy killing their enemies, enjoying their women and selling their defeated foes into slavery. (Absolutely Fresh!)
","As a child, Thorfinn sat at the feet of the great Leif Ericson and thrilled to wild tales of a land far to the west. But his youthful fantasies were shattered by a mercenary raid. Raised by the Vikings who murdered his family, Thorfinn became a terrifying warrior, forever seeking to kill the bands leader, Askeladd, and avenge his father. Sustaining Thorfinn through his ordeal are his pride in his family and his dreams of a fertile westward land, a land without war or slavery… the land Leif called Vinland."

Thats as spoiler free as I can give you. I would say the first few chapters of the series are very generic and is not as interesting as chainsawman. But it picks up, alot.

Escalations mainly occured in chapter 14, as we deeper look into power systems. chapter 40ish, with great chemistry between characters, and then chapter 70ish as we learn more about the things that went about. Additionally, the side story Tokyo Metropolitan Magic Technical School is also a good read and helps you understand the world more.

The world seems not yet vastly explored, weve only seen two schools so far and have not seen the head of different jujutsu families yet. We are not yet exposed to many potential story lines, and neither do we completely grasp the magic system (whcih definitely has hard rules) yet. Read it now, and enjoy the ride.","For some strange reason, Yuji Itadori, despite his insane athleticism would rather just hang out with the Occult Club.

Fighter D is such an endearing MC that you cant help but root for him. Watching him grow and learn with every new Vol is exciting. Not to mention his design is adorable, its great seeing so much expression on such a simply designed face.

All the secondary characters are also extremely well-written and just as expanded on perfectly. Though there are a lot of them. I do find myself finding it hard to remember everyones name, especially when they havent been used for a while.

The overarching story is so well-written that it just pulls you in. Each new piece of information is exciting to learn and not just something that can be found annoying to add to the story.

Highly recommend!","Thirteen years ago, suddenly the Villainous Army of evil appeared in their gigantic floating castle 10000 meters in the sky to invade Earth!

it has all of those weirdness of chainsaw man and epic action scenes of hells paradise [yes all of it in ch 1] the world still isnt fleshed out enough but since its the first chapter, we dont need to worry about that too much.
i liked the characters....and their weird quirks ofc. the art is very good imo, if u enjoyed jigokuraku then youll enjoy this for sure......it doesnt have berserk level of detail into it but its good.

all in all, you should give it a try","After being aggressively rejected, Momo Ayase finds herself sulking when she stumbles across a boy being bullied. Saved by her rash kindness, the occult-obsessed boy attempts to speak to her about supernatural interests he believes they share. Rejecting his claims, Ayase proclaimed that she is instead a believer in ghosts, starting an argument between the two over which is real.

In a bet to determine whos correct, the two decide to separately visit locations associated with both the occult and the supernatural—Ayase visiting the former and the boy visiting the latter. When the two reach their respective places, it turns out that neither of them was wrong and that both the occult and ghosts do exist.

This marks the beginning of Ayase and the boys adventure, who shares a name with Ayases favorite idol—Ken Takakura, as they attempt to fix the surreal supernatural and sci-fi elements around them to return to a normal life."

The hype isnt necessarily because its that good or anything, its just a funny joke. The actuality of Kagurabachi is that its a pretty generic shounen with an edgy protagonist and good art. At the time of writing this there is only 2 chapters out so I can not really judge if its good or not however I can say it has potential. With series like Black clover and My hero academia reaching their climaxes new promising manga has to come out of shounen jump and i believe that this could be one of them.

I would definitely say you should check this out if youre into shounen manga but you might want to wait for a few more chapters to come out.","Young Chihiro spends his days training under his famous swordsmith father.

The artstyle and character design is good (except for Panepane the annoying support fairy who looks like an unholy lovechild of Dimple and Oolong) and the plot feels fresh and interesting, giving us a seemingly strong protagonist and then making him look like Mumen Rider trying to stand up against the Deep Sea King. And since there is no One Punch-Man in this world to take care of the natural enemies, the humans from different worlds need to work together and use cunning and clever tactics to have even the slightest chance of survival. It’s entertaining to see how the different natural enemies interact with each other and who will be the greatest threat in the end.","Centuries ago, humanity’s natural enemy, “Demons,” invaded the world and oppressed humankind. The Great Demon Lord and 47 subordinates known as Demon Lords have since dominated the world, while the human race lives on in fear.
